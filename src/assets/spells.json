You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities\n derived from class levels, but you lose any from your normal form\n that are not derived from class levels. If the new form is capable\n of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any\n spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new\n form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a\n language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of\n fine manipulation to use somatic or material components. You\n acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining\n your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane\n movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking,\n swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet\n for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor\n bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial\n skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical\n qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities,\n and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make\n more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than\n normal. You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or\n special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such\n as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast\n healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth. You do not gain any\n supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like\n abilities of the new form. Your creature type and subtype (if any)\n remain the same regardless of your new form. You cannot take the\n form of any creature with a template, even if that template\n doesn't change the creature type or subtype. You can freely\n designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair\n color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for\n a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical\n qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your\n control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's\n kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the\n new form's race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you\n get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check. When the change occurs,\n your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new\n form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds\n into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to\n your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form\n reappear in the same location on your body they previously\n occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in\n the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and\n land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry\n in a body part common to both forms at the time of reversion are\n still held in the same way.

				"description": "An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with\n you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most\n magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and\n supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of\n any magic items or spells within its confines. An antimagic field\n suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into,\n or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within\n an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration.\n Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if\n they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once\n the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against\n the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature.\n If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned\n creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level\n check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell\n resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous\n conjurations are not affected by an antimagic field because the\n conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.) A\n normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles.\n Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically\n within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at\n that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that\n are imbued with magic during their creation process and are\n thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in\n which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures).\n Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise\n unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or\n supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by\n the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field. Two or more\n antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on\n each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic\n sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field\n (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are\n unaffected by mortal magic such as this.  Should a creature be\n larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that\n lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.",

If\n the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under\n some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to\n you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate\n misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must\n intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in\n order to expunge the subject's burden. Many casters first assign a\n subject of this sort a quest (see geas/quest) or similar penance\n to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting\n the atonement spell on its behalf. Atonement may be cast for one\n of several purposes, depending on the version selected. Reverse\n Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment\n magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original\n status at no cost in experience points. Restore Class: A paladin\n who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may\n have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell. Restore Cleric\n or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability\n to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may\n regain that ability by seeking atonement from another cleric of\n the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was\n intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession.\n If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.\n Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature\n of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change\n its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be\n present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the\n spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original\n alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your\n alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force\n the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is\n unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does\n not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its\n alignment naturally. Though the spell description refers to evil\n acts, atonement can also be used on any creature that has\n performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil,\n good, chaotic, or lawful. Note: Normally, changing alignment is up\n to the player. This use of atonement simply offers a believable\n way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically,\n suddenly, and definitively.",

You may have as many as six assistants help you with the\n spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level\n for this casting of binding increases by 1. For each assistant who\n casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your\n caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number\n equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the\n spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the\n assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level\n for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell\n resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your\n caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will\n saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding spells\n are dismissible. Regardless of the version of binding you cast,\n you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and\n release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as\n simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be\n reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions\n can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but\n otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.\n Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't\n qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot\n be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC\n (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2. If you are casting any\n of the first three versions of binding (those with limited\n durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the\n effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets\n a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if\n your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving\n throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the binding\n spells it has received are broken. The binding spell has six\n versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the\n spell. Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that\n generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach\n the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster\n level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot\n it occupied when it received the spell. Slumber: This version\n causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per\n caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while\n slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is more\n difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to\n resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. Bound Slumber: This\n combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month\n per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Hedged Prison: The\n subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined\n area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is\n permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Metamorphosis: The subject\n assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held\n harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if\n you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and\n can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any\n of its powers or abilities. The binding is permanent. The subject\n does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor\n does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. Minimus Containment: The\n subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held\n within some gem, jar, or similar object. The binding is permanent.\n The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while\n contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. You can't\n dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect,\n though an antimagic field or Mage's disjunction affects it\n normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its\n home plane due to dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect. In\n addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type\n of binding (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least\n 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved\n statuette of the subject to be captured.",

Blinking has several effects, as follows. Physical attacks\n against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat\n doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely\n invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal\n creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment). If the\n attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only\n 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal\n creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks\n have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as\n you are about to strike. Any individually targeted spell has a 50%\n chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your\n attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells\n have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which\n case they typically do not affect the Material Plane. While\n blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full\n damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike\n as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls),\n denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC. You take only half\n damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.\n While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid\n objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there\n is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are\n shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of\n damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters\n speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed,\n and you spend about half your time there and half your time\n material.) Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal\n Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You\n interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact\n with material ones. An ethereal creature is invisible,\n incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or\n down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid\n objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see\n and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and\n insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited\n to 60 feet. Force effects and abjurations affect you normally.\n Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material\n Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack\n material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only\n other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have\n attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other\n ethereal creatures and objects as material.",

				"description": "You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells\n that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily\n suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing\n spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter\n another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its\n duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their\n descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can\n dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does\n spells. Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration\n can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over\n before the dispel magic can take effect.  You choose to use dispel\n magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or\n a counterspell: Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is\n the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check\n (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or\n against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or\n creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster\n level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is\n dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect. If you\n target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing\n spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make\n a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or\n creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make\n a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed,\n all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds,\n after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item\n becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An\n interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is\n temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are\n unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork\n sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal\n magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check\n against any spell that you cast yourself. Area Dispel: When dispel\n magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a\n 30-foot radius. For each creature within the area that is the\n subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the\n spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make\n dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel\n one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that\n target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The\n creature's magic items are not affected. For each object within\n the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel\n checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area\n dispel. For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of\n origin is within the area of the dispel magic spell, you can make\n a dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose\n area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a\n dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping\n area. If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing\n spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the\n area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured\n that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition\n to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.\n You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against\n any spell that you have cast. Counterspell: When dispel magic is\n used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a\n counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic\n may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other\n spellcaster's spell.",

				"description": "Casting a gate spell has two effects. First, it\n creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of\n existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between\n those two planes in either direction. Second, you may then\n call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate.\n The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in\n diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire\n when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you).\n It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you\n specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that\n moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. A gate has a\n front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front\n are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it\n from the back are not. Planar Travel: As a mode of planar travel,\n a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that\n the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation\n effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can\n prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes\n if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you-anyone\n who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate\n cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell\n works only for interplanar travel. You may hold the gate open only\n for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you\n must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection\n is severed. Calling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell\n is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect).\n By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the\n spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the\n desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or\n unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to\n come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their\n own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open\n just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of\n the spell has an XP cost (see below). If you choose to call a kind\n of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a\n single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and\n control several creatures as long as their HD total does not\n exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you\n can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A\n single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be\n controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any\n event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the\n calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being\n may return to its home plane at any time. A controlled creature\n can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall\n into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service.\n Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions\n that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as\n an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any\n reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of\n the spell. If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form\n of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade\n in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable\n with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser\n planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may\n want their payment in \"livestock\" rather than in coin,\n which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of\n the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you\n must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is\n done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.\n Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being\n subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master,\n at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack\n you. Note: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an\n air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature,\n it becomes a spell of that type.",

Note: Magic traps such as glyph of warding are hard to\n detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to\n find the glyph and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each\n case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for glyph of warding. Depending on\n the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or\n activates a spell. Blast Glyph: A blast glyph deals 1d8 points of\n damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to\n all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire,\n electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting).\n Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half\n damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect. Spell Glyph:\n You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you\n know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your\n caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell has a\n target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an\n amorphous effect the area or effect is centered on the intruder.\n If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible\n to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance\n operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the\n spell stored in the glyph.",

If\n you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the\n resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs\n you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend\n lore result next time). During the casting, you cannot engage in\n other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth.\n When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the\n person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that\n are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even\n information that has never been generally known. If the person,\n place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no\n information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and\n higher are \"legendary,\" as are the sorts of creatures\n they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the\n places where they perform their key deeds.",

If a creature too\n large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell,\n the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that\n creature only. A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap.\n If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of\n spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped\n creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or\n indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has\n spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day.

A creature capable of any form of\n dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door,\n etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and\n similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means.\n You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting\n a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell\n before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect\n lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach\n across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons,\n spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can\n attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for\n the circle itself. You can add a special diagram (a\n two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its\n circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the\n magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10\n minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the\n result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is\n ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are\n under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task\n also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you\n devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20. A\n successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell\n on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning\n spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle\n for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell\n resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and\n none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the\n creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the\n lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature\n is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a\n straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb\n the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above. This\n spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa.",

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby\n body, forcing its soul into the magic jar. You may move back to\n the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and\n attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your\n soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast\n the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must\n know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of\n effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body\n is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.  While in the magic jar, you\n can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster\n level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of\n effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the\n exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group\n of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice\n between one creature and another and can determine whether a life\n force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures\n are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures\n have, or are, souls.) You could choose to take over either a\n stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or\n weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.\n Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked\n by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body\n and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the\n subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host\n leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target\n automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to\n possess its body again. If you are successful, your life force\n occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in\n the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma,\n level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and\n mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity,\n Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic\n abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more\n attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You\n can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural\n abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not\n stay with the body. As a standard action, you can shift freely\n from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped\n soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar\n to your own body. If the host body is slain, you return to the\n magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs\n (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the\n spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to\n go is treated as slain. If the spell ends while you are in the\n magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of\n range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host,\n you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your\n current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its\n body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle\n ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic\n jar or at the host's location.",

If you serve no particular deity, the spell is\n a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical\n alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may\n request that individual by speaking the name during the spell\n (though you might get a different creature anyway). You may ask\n the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from\n you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be\n able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain\n for its services. The creature called requires a payment for its\n services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating\n gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly\n to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches\n the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must\n be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The\n bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature\n begin in the round after it arrives. A task taking up to 1 minute\n per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the\n creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level,\n the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term\n task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a\n payment of 1,000 gp per HD. A nonhazardous task requires only half\n the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might\n require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task\n that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies\n when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the\n task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve\n or even waive the payment.  At the end of its task, or when the\n duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home\n plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).\n Note: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic,\n earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell\n of that type.",

The called\n creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one\n service in return for its freedom. To create the trap, you must\n use a magic circle spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to\n be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific\n individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting\n the spell. The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If\n the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the\n saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap\n (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The\n creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its\n spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional\n travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your\n caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per\n day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A dimensional\n anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional\n travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see magic circle\n against evil) to make the trap more secure. If the creature does\n not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as\n you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a\n service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort\n of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's\n Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on\n the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the\n opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the\n like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This\n process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve,\n until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by\n means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable\n commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma\n check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or\n attack you. Once the requested service is completed, the creature\n need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came.\n The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some\n open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own\n actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per\n caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break\n free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.\n When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil,\n fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

If an eye ever gets\n more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist.\n However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the\n eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of\n some other event. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level\n or until they return to you. Dispel magic can destroy eyes. Roll\n separately for each eye caught in an area dispel.

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon\n favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance\n or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and\n critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the\n opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the\n spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn.\n It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple\n attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier\n as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so,\n for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction.\n As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the\n normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon\n always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking\n bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do\n not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range,\n if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the\n weapon returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you\n can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If\n you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's\n target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one\n attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the\n weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would\n allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use\n the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and\n switching targets still is a move action. A spiritual weapon\n cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel\n magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of\n cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon's AC against touch\n attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object). If an attacked\n creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20\n + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the\n spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully\n resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its\n normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.\n The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's\n own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based\n on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a\n spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least\n generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons\n associated with each alignment are as follows. Chaos: Battleaxe\n Evil: Light flail Good: Warhammer Law: Longsword, ",

				"description": "This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of\n power upon a surface. When triggered, a symbol of death\n slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as\n a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed\n 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first,\n skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once\n triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10\n minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points'\n worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that\n enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to\n its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it\n was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once\n as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the\n area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save\n again. Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive\n (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be\n effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight\n and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders\n the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the\n covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally. As a\n default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does\n one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune;\n reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes\n through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger\n method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a\n symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of\n the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the\n spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be\n changed. In this case, \"reading\" the rune means any\n attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing\n a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers\n it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a symbol of death\n offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death\n remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used\n to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed\n on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe. You\n can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can\n be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for\n triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name,\n identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable\n actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice,\n and hit points don't qualify.  When scribing a symbol of death,\n you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature\n using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password\n remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the\n creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature\n leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password\n again. You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol\n of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one\n or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group\n (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour.\n Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24\n hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any\n creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is\n immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered.\n You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of\n death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently\n trigger them. Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death\n with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the symbol of death\n is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the\n symbol. A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel\n magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on\n a symbol of death. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of\n death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.\n Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A\n permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected\n its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes,\n then can be triggered again as normal. Note: Magic traps such as\n symbol of death are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can\n use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device\n to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for\n symbol of death.",

				"description": "You move objects or creatures by concentrating on\n them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can\n provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of\n combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.\n Sustained Force: A sustained force moves an object weighing no\n more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th\n level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect\n on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with\n spell resistance. This version of the spell can last 1 round per\n caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight\n can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An\n object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the\n object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for\n any reason, the object falls or stops. An object can be\n telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a\n lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object\n rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight\n limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though\n delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks.\n Combat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use\n telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including\n pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they\n don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in\n place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use\n your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if\n a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a\n failed attempt doesn't allow a reactive attempt by the target\n (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these\n attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of\n the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you\n cease concentration. Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell\n energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or\n creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and\n all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet\n per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of\n 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level). You\n must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown)\n to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus +\n your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if\n a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength\n bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their\n size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging\n from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6\n points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).\n Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be\n hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to\n negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are\n targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against\n a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).",

This\n has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature\n attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its\n way through the barrier. Creatures can force their way slowly\n through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round\n action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a\n creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its\n normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move\n through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature\n trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to\n avoid taking any more damage. Any creature within the area of the\n spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the\n wall and is caught inside.

Creatures\n with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can\n pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking\n damage.

The\n strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher.\n These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and\n diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself\n and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become entangled\n among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won't cause\n you to become entangled. Anyone in the effect's area when the\n spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the\n creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though\n moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see\n below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't\n move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and\n making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once\n loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later\n Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains\n entangled, but may move through the web very slowly. Each round\n devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check\n or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5\n points by which the check result exceeds 10. If you have at least\n 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If\n you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total\n cover. The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming\n sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away\n cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square\n feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points\n of fire damage from the flames. Web can be made permanent with a\n permanency spell. A permanent web that is damaged (but not\n destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.",

A wish can\n produce any one of the following effects. o Duplicate any wizard\n or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not\n of a school prohibited to you. o Duplicate any other spell of 6th\n level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited\n to you. o Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or\n lower even if it's of a prohibited school. o Duplicate any other\n spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.\n o Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as\n geas/quest or insanity. o Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000\n gp in value. o Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an\n existing magic item. o Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an\n ability score. Two to five wish spells cast in immediate\n succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an\n ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3\n inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so\n they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed\n +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a\n particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one\n applies. o Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid\n one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the\n same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the\n damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison\n effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same\n wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from\n casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being\n raised from the dead. o Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead\n creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish\n can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the\n task takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another to\n infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot prevent a character\n who was brought back to life from losing an experience level. o\n Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level\n from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else\n on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target\n gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if\n any) applies. o Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent\n event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last\n round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to\n accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo an\n opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit\n (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed\n save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse\n than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to\n negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies. You may\n try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing\n so is dangerous. (The wish may pervert your intent into a literal\n but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.)\n Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but\n save DCs are for 9th-level spells).",
